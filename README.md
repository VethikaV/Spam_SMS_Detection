Spam SMS Detection Project Description
Overview:
The Spam SMS Detection project aims to develop a system that can classify incoming text messages (SMS) as either spam or legitimate (ham). With the increasing prevalence of unsolicited messages, this project provides a tool to automatically detect and filter spam messages, enhancing user experience and protecting privacy.

Features:

Text Classification:

Uses machine learning techniques to classify SMS messages as spam or ham based on their content.Preprocessing:
Tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization to prepare the SMS data for analysis.Model Training:
Implements popular algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Neural Networks for training.Evaluation Metrics:
Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure model performance. User-Friendly Interface:
Provides a simple interface where users can input SMS messages and get real-time classification results.Data Visualization:
Displays insights such as the most common spam words, message lengths, and classification patterns.

Future Enhancements:

Support for multilingual spam detection.
Integration with real-time SMS APIs for dynamic analysis.
Incorporating deep learning models like LSTMs or Transformers for improved accuracy.
Advanced handling of phishing messages and URLs in spam.
This project not only serves as a practical example of text classification but also addresses a common and real-world problem effectively.
