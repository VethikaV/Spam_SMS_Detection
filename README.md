# Spam_SMS_Detection
The Spam SMS Detection project aims to develop a system that can classify incoming text messages (SMS) as either spam or legitimate (ham). With the increasing prevalence of unsolicited messages, this project provides a tool to automatically detect and filter spam messages, enhancing user experience and protecting privacy.
